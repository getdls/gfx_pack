# Original by N Haas GPL 
# Order dither converted from reshade Crosire et al.
#
# Works better when applied to a shader (sky, video..)  
# instead of as a post filter. Both for performance and fixing quantization errors. 


# The threshold of difference below which a pixel is considered to be part of
# a gradient. Higher = more debanding, but setting it too high diminishes image
# details.
# THRESHOLD 64
# 
# The range (in source pixels) at which to sample for neighbours. Higher values
# will find more gradients, but lower values will deband more aggressively.
# RANGE 8
# 
# The number of debanding iterations to perform. Each iteration samples from
# random positions, so increasing the number of iterations is likely to
# increase the debanding quality. Conversely, it slows the shader down.
# (Each iteration will use a multiple of the configured RANGE, and a
# successively lower THRESHOLD - so setting it much higher has little effect)
# ITERATIONS 4
# 
# (Optional) Add some extra noise to the image. This significantly helps cover
# up remaining banding and blocking artifacts, at comparatively little visual
# quality. Higher = more grain. Setting it to 1 disables the effect.
# GRAIN 48
